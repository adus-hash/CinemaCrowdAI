## Project goals

Project goals are: 

1. Use machine learning algorithms to predict attendance in cinema

2. Learn and compare different ML algorithms (Linear regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine)

## Dataset

It is artificially made, consist of 7 variables and first 5 samples look like this:

Our target variable is "Attendance (%)" which we aim to predict with our model using the other variables, hoever here are steps we need to do at first:
  - We need to encode string data into numeric
  - Fill missing datas with 0's
  - Covariance, Correlation
  - Choose best variables that correlate with target variable
